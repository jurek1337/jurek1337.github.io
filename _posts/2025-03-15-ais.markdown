One day, during a meetup with old friends, we started talking about Artificial Intelligence and image generation. That’s when the idea was born—a homemade AI server without the daily credit limitations of cloud-based solutions.  
So, we got to work. We gathered scrap parts and components from a closed computer shop to build our own solution.

![AI Server First Version]({{ '/assets/server.jpg' | relative_url }})
*First version of the server, with underclocked Pentium E6500, which is not supported by ROCm*

# The final specs
* *CPU* Ryzen 3 4100
* *RAM* 16GB DDR4 2400
* *GPU* ASUS RX 580 4GB
* *PSU* Thermaltake Litepower 650W
* *HDD* Toshiba 1TB
* *OS* Red Hat Enterprise Linux

The work is still in progress... At first, we tried using a completely rubbish Conroe-based system with 4GB of RAM, but ROCm doesn't support it
Once it's fully functional, you’ll be able to check it out [here](http://ai.danielakajerzy.net). And I'll also share more updates soon!
