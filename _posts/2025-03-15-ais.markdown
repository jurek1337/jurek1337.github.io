One day in old friend's meetup we were talking about Artiffical Intelligence and image generation. And there's and invention - homemade server, which doesn't have a little amount of credits to use per day.
So, we go to work. We combined rubbish and parts from closed computer shop.

![AI Server First Version]({{ '/assets/server.jpg' | relative_url }})
*First version of the server, with underclocked Pentium E6500, which is not supported by ROCm*

# The final specs
* *CPU* Ryzen 3 4100
* *RAM* 16GB DDR4 2400
* *GPU* ASUS RX 580 4GB
* *PSU* Thermaltake Litepower 650W
* *HDD* Toshiba 1TB
* *OS* Red Hat Enterprise Linux

Works still in progress... we first try completely rubbish Conroe-based system with 4GB of RAM, but ROCm doesn't support this.
If I done, you can see something [here](http://ai.danielakajerzy.net). And I wrote some new informations.
