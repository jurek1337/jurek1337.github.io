# Welcome to my page!
My name is Daniel and currently I am studying at third year on Cracow University of Technology. I can speak Polish, English (C1) and a little Italian (currently learning at A1 level)

I'm interested in social mechanisms, music, IT and computer games ðŸ˜›
In IT I like a lot of things: programming, repairing stuff and managing servers (at this moment I have 2! running on Proxmox and RHEL).
